## Overview

MetalFish is a chess engine that combines traditional alpha-beta search techniques from Stockfish with Apple Metal GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture.

## Features

### Search (29 Stockfish Features Implemented)

#### Move Ordering
- **ButterflyHistory** - Quiet move success tracking by from/to squares
- **KillerMoves** - Refutation moves per ply
- **CounterMoveHistory** - Moves that refute the previous move
- **CapturePieceToHistory** - Capture move success tracking
- **PawnHistory** - Pawn structure-aware history (indexed by pawn key)
- **LowPlyHistory** - Extra weight for moves near root (first 5 plies)
- **ContinuationHistory** - Move sequence success (1, 2, 4 ply lookback)

#### Search Extensions
- **Check Extension** - Extend when giving check
- **Singular Extension** - Extend clearly best moves
- **Multi-Cut Pruning** - Within singular extension framework
- **Passed Pawn Extension** - Extend for pawns reaching 7th rank
- **Recapture Extension** - Via LMR reduction decrease
- **Upcoming Repetition Detection** - Proactive repetition avoidance

#### Pruning Techniques
- **Null Move Pruning** - With verification search
- **Futility Pruning** - For quiet moves and captures
- **SEE-based Pruning** - Static Exchange Evaluation pruning
- **Late Move Pruning (LMP)** - Skip late quiet moves at shallow depths
- **Late Move Reductions (LMR)** - 14+ adjustment factors
- **ProbCut** - Prune with shallow capture search
- **Mate Distance Pruning** - Prune when short mate found
- **Internal Iterative Reductions (IIR)** - Reduce depth without TT move
- **History-based Pruning** - Skip moves with very negative history

#### Evaluation
- **NNUE Support** - Stockfish .nnue file loading
- **Rule50 Dampening** - Linear eval reduction as 50-move rule approaches
- **Correction History** - Adjust static eval based on search results
- **Draw Randomization** - Prevent 3-fold repetition blindness

#### Search Infrastructure
- **Transposition Table** - With aging and generation tracking
- **Aspiration Windows** - With averaging and fail-high tracking
- **Best Move Stability** - For time management decisions
- **Dynamic Time Management** - Adjust based on stability and score changes
- **Iterative Deepening** - Progressive deepening with info output
- **Quiescence Search** - Tactical resolution at leaf nodes

### GPU Acceleration (Metal)
- GPU-accelerated batch position evaluation
- Metal compute shaders for NNUE forward pass
- Unified memory (zero-copy) on Apple Silicon
- GPU-accelerated move generation helpers
- GPU-accelerated SEE calculation

### Move Generation
- Magic bitboards for sliding pieces
- Legal move generation with pin detection
- Perft verification (all standard positions pass)

## Not Yet Implemented (Major Stockfish Features)

- **Lazy SMP** - Multi-threaded search
- **Syzygy Tablebases** - Endgame tablebase probing
- **MultiPV** - Multiple principal variation search
- **Pondering** - Thinking on opponent's time
- **NNUE Incremental Updates** - Efficient accumulator updates
- **Full Continuation History** - 6-ply lookback (currently 4-ply)
- **Optimism Blending** - Material-scaled optimism in eval
- **Cuckoo Hashing** - For faster repetition detection

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- CMake 3.20+
- Xcode Command Line Tools

## Building

```bash
cd metalfish
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

## Usage

```bash
./metalfish
```

UCI commands:
```
uci
position startpos
go depth 15
go movetime 5000
quit
```

## Testing

```bash
# C++ unit tests
./build/metalfish_tests

# Python perft tests
python3 tests/testing.py
```

## Performance Notes

MetalFish uses GPU acceleration primarily for batch evaluation scenarios. For single-position evaluation during search, the overhead of GPU dispatch (~10-50μs) often exceeds the computational benefit. The engine automatically falls back to CPU evaluation for single positions while using GPU for batch operations where parallelism provides net benefit.

### Notes
- All benchmarks run on identical GitHub Actions `macos-14` runners (Apple Silicon)
- Hash size: 256 MB, Threads: 1 (single-threaded for fair comparison)
- MetalFish uses GPU acceleration via Metal for NNUE evaluation
- Stockfish is the official build with Apple Silicon optimizations
- LC0 requires neural network weights (may not build in CI)
